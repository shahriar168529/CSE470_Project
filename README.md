ReWater (Eco Water) — The Reusable Water System
Sustainable Water for a Smarter Future

In Bangladesh, a 5-liter bottled water pack costs about 120 BDT, yet single-use plastic bottles damage the environment and increase household expenses.
ReWater is a sustainable business and mobile app ecosystem that replaces disposable bottles with refillable containers, promoting affordability, convenience, and environmental care.

Overview

Buy your first 5-liter reusable bottle (including water) for 150 BDT, then refill it 4–5 times (or more) for only 30–40 BDT per refill.

Benefits:

Save money

Reduce plastic waste

Build a cleaner, greener future
